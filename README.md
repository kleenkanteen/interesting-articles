balancing humility and confidence. understand you are always learning, There is always something you can learn from someone. Care about those under you. "Humility is an essential trait of an effective leader. Defined as “freedom from pride or arrogance” humility is not the opposite of confidence. Instead, it is an important complement to it. It is an honest appreciation and acceptance of reality. Humility recognizes that none of us is better than anyone else. That our titles do not elevate us. That our learning has only just begun, no matter where we may be on our respective journeys."

The rules of success are universal, there are always lessons to be learnt, learn to gamify your life, You cannot hope to achieve success without taking action and actually taking the first step towards your dreams, 
I don’t care what this step is. It can be buying a new domain name, writing your first blog article, or launching your podcast. You have to get off your butt, show up, and do the work. The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step ~Lao Tzu - https://www.knowledgeformen.com/podcast-nicholas-cole/

The decision to go all out, take bold risks, and challenge the status quo comes with the price of being misunderstood, of suffering for years (possibly decades) in pursuit of the uncommon, and of facing judgment and ridicule from the very people who should support us.
No matter what you do, you’re paying a price. And the only decision that matters is what price you want to pay. You must pick your poison in this life…to either suffer the pain of discipline…or suffer the pain of regret. There is no middle ground and there is no free lunch.  - https://www.knowledgeformen.com/jordan-peterson-quotes/

Summary of the book the messy middle, many points, my favorite one: One of my favorite sayings from ancient times is “Wealth is ultimately feeling like you got your full portion.” When I finish a project, I aspire to feel full.

What makes a winning team, "Many U.S. sports fans agree that the greatest victory in this country’s history was when a group of unknown college kids, 
led by head coach Herb Brooks, stunned the Soviets 4-3 in the 1980 Winter Olympics and went on to win the gold medal in ice hockey.
When asked how he assembled the team, as well as his University of Minnesota hockey teams (Brooks had taken Minnesota from a perpetual doormat to 
winning three Division 1 National Championships in 7 years), Brooks responded, “The key to my recruiting was that I looked for people first, athletes second. 
I wanted people with sound value systems because you cannot buy values. You are only as good as your values. I learned early on that 
you do not put greatness into people…but somehow try to pull it out.” - https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-locker-room

Again, the challenge is temporary, so pick something that is going to push you out of your comfort zone. If, after 30 days, you decide you don't want to continue with the challenge, then that's okay. At least you learned something valuable about yourself by completing the challenge. But if your challenge does lead to a positive change that you wish to continue, well, you just laid the groundwork for a successful habit. - https://lawsonblake.com/30-day-challenge/

We were put on this earth as a direct result of a collaboration between two people. Togetherness is in our bones. It is so very important to survival and happiness. We must work together and be kind to one another.
So today, be conscious of this. Choose to do something for someone else. Smile, hold the door open, take out the trash, ask someone how their day went. It’s not hard, and it doesn’t cost a dime. Try not to judge — we’re all in this together. Knocking someone down won’t do any good for you or anyone else. -

"Life is not about finding yourself, it's about creating yourself"
